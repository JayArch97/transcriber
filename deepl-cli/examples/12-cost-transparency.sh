echo "💡 Cost transparency benefits:"
echo "   - Accurate billing visibility"
echo "   - Budget planning and forecasting"
echo "   - Cost optimization opportunities"
echo "   - Transparent API usage tracking"
echo

echo "📊 Cost tracking tips:"
echo "   - Use --show-billed-characters for budget-sensitive operations"
echo "   - Track costs per project or feature"
echo "   - Leverage caching to reduce API costs"
echo "   - Monitor costs in CI/CD pipelines"
echo "   - Combine with JSON output for automated cost analysis"
echo

echo "💰 Understanding billing:"
echo "   - Billed characters = actual characters sent to API"
echo "   - Cached translations are not billed again"
echo "   - Multiple target languages multiply the cost"
echo "   - Whitespace and formatting may affect character count"
echo "   - Code blocks (with --preserve-code) are included in billing"
echo

echo "🔍 Cost optimization strategies:"
echo "   - Enable caching to avoid repeat charges"
echo "   - Use glossaries to ensure consistency (no re-translation)"
echo "   - Batch translations efficiently"
echo "   - Monitor usage with 'deepl usage' command"
echo "   - Translate only changed content in watch mode"
